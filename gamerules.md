2 players
each have a 3x3 grid split into 3 lanes
random player goes first
rolls dice
can put in one of the lanes
placing one that the enemy has will eliminate all of them in that row
2 of a kind = double each eg 6,6 = 12 *2 = 24
3 of a kind = triple each eg 6,6,6 = 18*3= 54
highest number wins
